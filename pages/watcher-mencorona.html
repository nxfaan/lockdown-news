                <p>More men are dying from COVID-19 worldwide than women, and the potential reasons run the gamut from
                  biology to bad habits.
                  <br><br>
                  A study published in April in Frontiers in Public Health reported that men and women were equally
                  likely to contract the novel coronavirus.
                  <br><br>
                  However, the researchers also reported that men are significantly more likely to suffer severe effects
                  of the disease.
                  <br><br>
                  The Chinese researchers said that in one large subset of COVID-19 patients, more than 70 percent of
                  those who died were men.
                  <br><br>
                  They said they found similar results when they examined research from the 2003 outbreak of severe
                  acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
                  <br><br>
                  The study was backed up by other figures released since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
                  <br><br>
                  The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that 63 percent of deaths related to COVID-19 in
                  Europe have been among men.
                  <br><br>
                  A study by the Higher Health Institute of Rome in March found that among Italians hospitalized for the
                  novel coronavirus, 8 percent of men died compared to 5 percent of women.
                  <br><br>
                  In New York City, men have been dying of coronavirus at almost twice the rate of women. The city’s
                  health department reported in early April that 43 COVID-19 deaths for every 100,000 men, compared with
                  23 deaths for every 100,000 women.
                  <br><br>
                  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently isn’t reporting COVID-19 deaths by
                  gender, but experts see no reason the trend would differ elsewhere in the country.
                  <br><br>
                  “Some of the underlying reasons why COVID-19 may be more deadly for men than women may include the
                  fact that heart disease is more common in elderly men than in elderly women,” Dr. Stephen Berger, an
                  infectious disease expert and co-founder of the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network
                  (GIDEON), told Healthline. “Studies also find that high blood pressure and liver disease are more
                  prevalent in men and these all contribute to more negative outcomes with COVID-19.”
                  <br><br>
                  Enzymes and immune systems
                  A study published on May 10 reported that men men have higher concentrations of angiotensin-converting
                  enzyme 2 (ACE2) in their blood than women.
                  <br><br>
                  Since ACE2 enables the coronavirus to infect healthy cells, this may help to explain why men are more
                  vulnerable to COVID-19 than women, the researchers reported.
                  <br><br>
                  The immune system may also be a factor.
                  <br><br>
                  “Genetics may also play a big role,” Berger said. “Women, because of their extra X chromosome, have a
                  stronger immune system and response to infections than men.”
                  <br><br>
                  “You can’t get away from biology and genetics,” agreed Salvatore J. Giorgianni, PharmD, a pharmacist
                  and senior science advisor for the Men’s Health Network, which advocates for the health of men and
                  boys.
                  <br><br>
                  The phenomenon actually prompted the launch of two clinical trials in the United States.
                  <br><br>
                  In these trials, scientists are giving men with COVID-19 sex hormones such as estrogen to see if that
                  will help them recover from the illness.


                </p>
                <blockquote> Men are actually the ‘weaker sex’
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  Males are culturally conditioned to think of themselves as strong, Giorgianni told Healthline, but
                  “women are not the ‘weaker sex’ when it comes to immunity.”
                  <br><br>
                  Moreover, he noted, men have higher rates in 9 out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United
                  States.
                  <br><br>
                  That means they’re more likely to have preexisting conditions that can make COVID-19 more dangerous.
                  <br><br>
                  Behaviors that impact lung health, such as smoking, also may play a role in the disease’s deadly
                  impact on men.
                  <br><br>
                  “In China, for example, smoking is largely a male habit, resulting in many men suffering from chronic
                  lung disease,” Berger said. “This puts men at a much greater disadvantage should they get COVID-19.”
                  <br><br>
                  The WHO estimatesTrusted Source that air pollution kills more than 4 million people annually by
                  contributing to illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, lung and heart diseases, and
                  respiratory allergies.
                  <br><br>
                  A recent study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Massachusetts reported that
                  people who live in areas with high levels of air pollution are also more likely to die of COVID-19
                  than those in less polluted areas.
                  <br><br>
                  Pollution could also be playing a role in elevated COVID-19 mortality rates among men.
                  <br><br>
                  “In most cultures, men are more likely to be engaged in outdoor work, exposing them to conditions
                  associated with extreme climate and pollution,” Berger said. “This could directly impact their
                  response to an infection like COVID-19.”
                  <br><br>
                  High-risk occupations deemed “essential” under pandemic emergency orders — notably first responders —
                  also may be “disproportionately jobs men traditionally do,” Derek M. Griffith, PhD, director of the
                  Institute for Research on Men’s Health at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, told Healthline.
                  <br><br>
                  Higher rates of death among men in pandemics is not new.
                  <br><br>
                  ResearchTrusted Source on the worldwide flu of 1918, for example, found that non-elderly adult males
                  died at a much higher rate than women, possibly because more men had a history of lung-damaging
                  tuberculosis.
                  <br><br>
                  Risk taking may play a role
                  Male behavior during the pandemic also could be increasing their exposure to the novel coronavirus.
                  <br><br>
                  A Gallup poll taken between March 2 and 13 found that women were more concerned about COVID-19 than
                  men were (by a 62 to 58 percent margin).
                  <br><br>
                  “It’s possible that men are more at risk because they tend to expose themselves more to larger crowds
                  and social exchanges, including things like handshaking and sporting events,” Berger said.
                  <br><br>
                  “There are men with invincibility syndrome that underpins a lot of behaviors, and they tend to be less
                  compliant” with pandemic-related restrictions such as physical distancing, Giorgianni said.
                  <br><br>
                  For other men, he said, the issue isn’t so much a cavalier attitude as simply being conditioned “to
                  think of health as ‘not their job.’”
                  <br><br>
                  COVID-19 prevention messages aimed at men should focus on these traditional male roles, “not ignore
                  millions of year of biology and natural selection,” Giorgianni said.
                  <br><br>
                  “Guys are very concerned for their families, so tell them don’t do it for yourself, do it for those
                  who love you,” he said. “Even if they feel like they’re in good shape and can fight it off, they can
                  still be a carrier can cause the death of their spouse or daughter or their dad.”
                  <br><br>
                  Griffith cautioned, however, that much remains unknown about COVID-19, including its different impact
                  on men and women.
                  <br><br>
                  “It’s worth considering these factors, but it’s a little premature,” he said. “Most of these
                  statements seem to assume we know more about this disease than we do.”
                  <br><br>
                  Taking symptoms seriously
                  One thing that is well-proven, however, is that men tend to delay seeking healthcare and ignore or
                  dismiss symptoms of illness.
                  <br><br>
                  “Many men see self-care as an admission of weakness,” David Ezell, chief executive officer of Darien
                  Wellness, a mental health group in Connecticut, told Healthline. “We are taught to be self-sufficient
                  and there for everyone but ourselves. That results in ignoring telltale symptoms of not only COVID but
                  any life-threatening condition.”
                  <br><br>
                  Dr. Deborah Birx, the COVID-19 response coordinator for the Trump administration, noted at an April 9
                  briefing that 56 percent of people who have been tested for the illness are male compared to 44
                  percent female.
                  <br><br>
                  Of the men who were tested, 23 percent were positive for COVID-19, compared to 16 percent of women.
                  <br><br>
                  “It gives you an idea about how men often don’t present in the healthcare delivery system until they
                  have greater symptomatology,” Birx said. “This is to all of our men out there, no matter what age
                  group: If you have symptoms, you should make sure that you are tested.”
